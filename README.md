# Python-Challenge
These are my solutions for the challenges found at http://www.pythonchallenge.com/. 
I started with Challenge number 4, as I didn't think to start saving my solutions until I had made it this far...anyway, comments to making my code better are always appreciated as I haven't been working with Python very long.
Thanks!
